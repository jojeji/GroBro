You can enable the relay by setting:
--env ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER=True

Note: Once enabled, your device can be controlled by Growatt. This can be seen as both a benefit and a potential risk, depending on your use case.

## v1.3
Use REGISTER_FILTER variable to set the right mapping for your Inverters and batteries.

Example: --env REGISTER_FILTER=QMN000XXXXXXXX:NEO800,YYYYYYYYXXXXX:NOAH

## v1.1
Added support for config messages and enhanced device information
