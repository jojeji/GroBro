## v1.4
Thanks to @justinh998 for adding two-way message forwarding to Growatt Cloud! ðŸŽ‰

You can enable the relay by setting:
--env ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER=True

Note: Once enabled, your device can be controlled by Growatt. This can be seen as both a benefit and a potential risk, depending on your use case.
